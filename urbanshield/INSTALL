Building Tunnelblick is easy.

Get the source from svn:

	svn checkout svn://tunnelblick.net/openvpngui

Or ensure you have the most up to date source:

	svn update svn://tunnelblick.net/openvpngui

Build it:

	cd openvpngui/trunk/
	make	

Install it from your terminal::

	open Tunnelblick-Universal-svn-bleeding-edge.dmg
	cp /Volumes/tunnelblick/Tunnelblick.app /Applications/

You can also easily install it from the Finder. Do so by opening the disk image and dragging the Tunnelblick application into the Applications folder.

And as usual, you can clean up the source tree after you're done. Don't forget to save the resulting disk image - this will erase it:

	make clean
