Having trouble compiling Tunnelblick? Perhaps these answers will help you.

Q: Can I build Tunnelblick on my xxx?

A: Tunnelblick can be built on any Mac OS X system with the proper developer tools. It builds on both PPC and Intel. It has been extensively tested on first generation Macbook Pro hardware. It has been known to compile on older Powermac G4 systems.

Q: It appears that the build cannot successfully create the disk image. I have the following error:

	hdiutil create -srcfolder /tmp/tunnelblick/
	Tunnelblick-Universal-svn-bleeding-edge.dmg
	hdiutil: create failed - Device not configured 

A: As described in hdiutil(1), hdiutil cannot be called from inside of a reattached screen session. Start a fresh session if you'd like to use screen to build Tunnelblick.

Q: It appears that I am unable to compile Tunnelblick because lzo fails to compile. What's going on?

	echelon:~/Desktop/openvpn/openvpngui paul$ cd trunk/
	echelon:~/Desktop/openvpn/openvpngui/trunk paul$ make
	# Here's where we'll call the top level third_party/Makefile
	cd ../third_party && make
	# First we configure lzo
	cd lzo-2.02/ && LDFLAGS="-arch i686 -arch ppc" CFLAGS="-Os -g -arch i686 -arch ppc -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk" ./configure --disable-dependency-tracking --disable-asm
	^C^Cmake[1]: *** [lzo] Error 1
	make: *** [third_party] Interrupt

A: It seems likely that your -isysroot is missing or of a different version (such as MacOSX10.1.5.sdk, MacOSX10.2.8.sdk, or MacOSX10.3.0.sdk ) than what is in the Tunnelblick Makefile. Ensure that you have the proper developer tools installed. Feel free to send a patch if you make it work with other versions of the SDK!

Q: gcc reports that it cannont creation executables:

	checking for gcc... gcc
	checking for C compiler default output file name... configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
	See `config.log' for more details.
	make[1]: *** [lzo] Error 77
	make: *** [third_party] Error 2


	lala:~/tmp/openvpngui/trunk lewis$ which gcc
	/usr/bin/gcc
	lala:~/tmp/openvpngui/trunk lewis$ /usr/bin/gcc -v
	Using built-in specs.
	Thread model: posix
	gcc version 3.3 20030304 (Apple Computer, Inc. build 1819)

A: Your version of gcc is too old (gcc 3.3 doesn't work, gcc 4.0.1 does). Make sure to have installed the latest version of Xcode from https://connect.apple.com/

Q: I have some weird issue with md5sum, what's going on here?

	hdiutil create -srcfolder /tmp/tunnelblick/ Tunnelblick-Universal-svn-bleeding-edge.dmg
	................................................................
	created: /Users/joe/Documents/tunnelblick/trunk/Tunnelblick-Universal-svn-bleeding-edge.dmg
	The md5sum of the freshly built dmg is:
	md5sum Tunnelblick-Universal-svn-bleeding-edge.dmg
	make: md5sum: Command not found
	make: *** [dmg] Error 127 

A: You don't appear to have md5sum installed. You should still have a proper disk image though you'll need to calculate the checksums yourself. Or install md5sum and try again.
