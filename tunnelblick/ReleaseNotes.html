 <p>The latest version of these release notes is located at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/wiki/ReleaseNotes" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/wiki/ReleaseNotes</a>. </p><p><strong>PLEASE DO</strong> discuss any problems on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/tunnelblick-discuss" rel="nofollow">Tunnelblick Discussion List</a>
before initiating an Issue. Issues are usually only looked at by the
developers; the Discussion List has a broader audience of members who
might be able to help! </p><p><strong>PLEASE DO NOT</strong> post comments at the bottom of this page (except comments about these Release Notes, of course). Use the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/tunnelblick-discuss" rel="nofollow">Tunnelblick Discussion List</a> instead. </p><p>For more information, see the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick" rel="nofollow">Tunnelblick website</a>. </p><h2><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">3.0b18 (2009-09-23)</a></h2><ul><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Implements
different behavior when configuration files change: when a
configuration file is added, all connections are maintained. When a
configuration file is deleted, only the corresponding connection is
disconnected (and an alert window is displayed). In either case, the
menu and Log window reflect the change immediately without restarting
Tunnelblick. Changes to a configuration file's contents or metadata are
ignored (but will be used the next time a connection is attempted). </a></li><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Works
with home folders on network volumes and/or when the home folder is not
permitted to have files owned by root. This is implemented
transparently with "shadow" copies of configuration files. It is
automatic if the config file is on a network volume or if Tunnelblick's
"useShadowConfigurationFiles" preference is set. </a></li><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Moves "Set nameserver" checkbox to avoid inadvertent changes. </a></li><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Fixes
issues when DNS is set manually, when 'dhcp-option DOMAIN ...' is
pushed to the client, and when --remote-random is used under certain
circumstances. </a></li><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Fixes misleading language in window that requests a username/password for the VPN. </a></li><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Fixes
a bug which caused OpenVPN Log window to stay on top of all other
windows if it was opened within 3 seconds of starting Tunnelblick. </a></li><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Fixes a bug which caused config file changes to be ignored under certain circumstances. </a></li><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Fixes
a bug which interferes with saving a username/password combination or a
passphrase to the Keychain when there is more than one simultaneous
connection. </a></li><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Fixes a bug which causes a (quitable) infinite loop if an error occurred while changing ownerships and/or permissions. </a></li><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Fixes a bug which sometimes causes non-English text of buttons or checkboxes to be truncated or clipped. </a></li><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Makes changes to ownership and permissions of parts of Tunnelblick.app for better security. </a></li><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Adds
support for WINS configurations from the server when using the standard
up/down scripts (i.e., when the "Set nameserver" checkbox is checked). </a></li><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Warns about multiple simultaneous connections, with a checkbox to suppress such warnings. </a></li><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Displays duration times only for connected tunnels. </a></li><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Updated to UKKQueue 0.5 and LZO 2.03 </a></li><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Adds Spanish localization (thanks to Diego Rivera). </a></li></ul><p><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Known Issues: </a></p><ul><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Does not work under Snow Leopard when booted into 64-bit mode. (Works when booted into 32-bit mode.) </a></li><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">The
"--redirect-gateway" OpenVPN option fails silently, causing incorrect
routing, if no flags are specified (which is a syntax error).
Previously, a flag of "def1" was assumed. </a></li><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Localization is not complete for French, German, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, or Spanish. </a></li><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">The
standard scripts that "Set nameserver" uses handle DNS for most common
setups. You must use custom scripts to do anything else. See the </a><a href="http://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/wiki/UsingTunnelblick" rel="nofollow">"Using Tunnelblick" wiki</a> for details. </li></ul><h2><a name="3.0b16_(2009-08-22)">3.0b16 (2009-08-22)</a></h2><ul><li><a name="3.0b16_(2009-08-22)">Upgraded to OpenVPN version 2.1_rc19 </a></li><li><a name="3.0b16_(2009-08-22)">Additional French translations (contributed by Oliver Hill) </a></li><li><a name="3.0b16_(2009-08-22)">An
entry is appended to the OpenVPN Log window if OpenVPN returns with an
error code. (This typically happens when there is an error in the
configuration file.) </a></li></ul><p><a name="3.0b16_(2009-08-22)">Known Issues: </a></p><ul><li><a name="3.0b16_(2009-08-22)">Home folders cannot reside on remote volumes (AFS, NFS, etc.) </a></li><li><a name="3.0b16_(2009-08-22)">Japanese and Norwegian localization is not complete. </a></li><li><a name="3.0b16_(2009-08-22)">The

common DHCP setups. You must use custom scripts to do anything else.

issue which caused disconnects when any file in ~/Library/openvpn was
accessed (for example, by backup software). (Note that changing,
adding, or deleting any configuration files will close all open
connections) </a></li><li><a name="3.0b14_(2009-08-10)">Fixed issue

"About" window that displays a link to the website, Tunnelblick version
and build numbers, and the OpenVPN version number, which is dynamically
extracted from the openvpn program (and thus always reports the version
of OpenVPN which is actually being used). </a></li><li><a name="3.0b14_(2009-08-10)">Fixed
issue which caused Tunnelblick to pass the "script-security 2"
