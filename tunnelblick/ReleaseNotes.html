different behavior when configuration files change: when a
configuration file is added, all connections are maintained. When a
configuration file is deleted, only the corresponding connection is
disconnected (and an alert window is displayed). In either case, the
menu and Log window reflect the change immediately without restarting
Tunnelblick. Changes to a configuration file's contents or metadata are
ignored (but will be used the next time a connection is attempted). </a></li><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Works
with home folders on network volumes and/or when the home folder is not
permitted to have files owned by root. This is implemented
transparently with "shadow" copies of configuration files. It is
automatic if the config file is on a network volume or if Tunnelblick's
"useShadowConfigurationFiles" preference is set. </a></li><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Moves "Set nameserver" checkbox to avoid inadvertent changes. </a></li><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Fixes
issues when DNS is set manually, when 'dhcp-option DOMAIN ...' is
pushed to the client, and when --remote-random is used under certain
circumstances. </a></li><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Fixes misleading language in window that requests a username/password for the VPN. </a></li><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Fixes
a bug which caused OpenVPN Log window to stay on top of all other
windows if it was opened within 3 seconds of starting Tunnelblick. </a></li><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Fixes a bug which caused config file changes to be ignored under certain circumstances. </a></li><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Fixes
a bug which interferes with saving a username/password combination or a
passphrase to the Keychain when there is more than one simultaneous
connection. </a></li><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Fixes a bug which causes a (quitable) infinite loop if an error occurred while changing ownerships and/or permissions. </a></li><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Fixes a bug which sometimes causes non-English text of buttons or checkboxes to be truncated or clipped. </a></li><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Makes changes to ownership and permissions of parts of Tunnelblick.app for better security. </a></li><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Adds
support for WINS configurations from the server when using the standard
up/down scripts (i.e., when the "Set nameserver" checkbox is checked). </a></li><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Warns about multiple simultaneous connections, with a checkbox to suppress such warnings. </a></li><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Displays duration times only for connected tunnels. </a></li><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Updated to UKKQueue 0.5 and LZO 2.03 </a></li><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Adds Spanish localization (thanks to Diego Rivera). </a></li></ul><p><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Known Issues: </a></p><ul><li><a name="3.0b18_(2009-09-23)">Does not work under Snow Leopard when booted into 64-bit mode.

issue which caused disconnects when any file in ~/Library/openvpn was
accessed (for example, by backup software). (Note that changing,
adding, or deleting any configuration files will close all open
connections) </a></li><li><a name="3.0b14_(2009-08-10)">Fixed issue
