<title>Using Tunnelblick</title><p style="text-align: left; clear: both;"><img src="using-tunnelblick-files/tb-logo.png" border="0"></p>
Tunnelblick is an OS X Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the OpenVPN free and 
open-source program, which maintains VPN "tunnels". It provides
easy-to-use control of OpenVPN server and/or client connections. It is
written in Cocoa, runs on OS X Tiger (10.4) and Leopard (10.5), and
comes as a ready to use Universal 32-bit application with all necessary binaries and
drivers, including OpenVPN. Tunnelblick is free software licensed under
the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html" rel="nofollow">GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2</a>.<br>

<b><a name="installing" rel="nofollow">INSTALLING TUNNELBLICK</a></b><br>
To install Tunnelblick, first download it from the 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/downloads/list" rel="nofollow">Downloads page</a>, 
then double-click the downloaded .dmg file. An icon for a &ldquo;Tunnelblick&rdquo; disk will appear on the Desktop, and a new window similar 
to the following will appear:<br>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center; clear: both;"><img src="using-tunnelblick-files/using-tunnelblick-dmg.png" border="0"></p>
<br>
<br>
Drag Tunnelblick.app (which may be labeled &ldquo;Tunnelblick&rdquo; without the
&ldquo;.app&rdquo;) and drop it on the shortcut to the Applications folder. This
will copy the application from the .dmg into the Applications folder.
You may then close the window and eject the &ldquo;Tunnelblick&rdquo; disk icon.<br>
<br>
There is no need to install OpenVPN separately - the Tunnelblick
application contains both the Tunnelblick GUI and OpenVPN. See the
Tunnelblick release notes to determine the version of OpenVPN included
with the version of Tunnelblick that you are using.<br>
<br>
If you wish Tunnelblick to appear in the Dock, navigate to Applications, and drag and drop Tunnelblick to the Dock.<br>
<br>
<b><a name="uninstalling" rel="nofollow">UNINSTALLING TUNNELBLICK</a><br>
</b>To uninstall Tunnelblick, move Tunnelblick.app from the
Applications folder to the Trash. Other than the preferences and
configuration files described in <a href="#filelocations" rel="nofollow">File Locations</a>, there are no
other files installed - OpenVPN and the tun/tap kernel extensions are
contained within the Tunnelblick.app package and are loaded only when
needed directly from there.<br>
<br>
<b><a name="configfiles" rel="nofollow">CONFIGURATION FILES</a><br>
</b>Each tunnel to be opened by Tunnelblick needs an OpenVPN configuration file. Tunnelblick considers any file 
located in ~/Library/openvpn with an extension of .conf or .ovpn to be a configuration file, and presents 
each file as a potential &ldquo;connection&rdquo;. Often these configuration files will be supplied to you. Refer to 
the <a href="http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation.html?Itemid=79">OpenVPN documentation</a> 
for details about what the configuration file should contain. (Note that the some OpenVPN options 
are available only on Windows.)<br>
<br>
If Tunnelblick's &ldquo;Set nameserver&rdquo; option is used:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Any &ldquo;up&rdquo; or &ldquo;down&rdquo; options in the configuration file will be ignored.</li>
  <li>If any &ldquo;user&rdquo; or &ldquo;group&rdquo; options appear in the configuration file, DNS settings will not be restored when a tunnel is disconnected.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b><a name="filelocations" rel="nofollow">FILE LOCATIONS</a><br>
</b>Tunnelblick preferences are contained in
~/Library/Preferences/com.openvpn.tunnelblick.plist. (The &ldquo;~&rdquo; indicates your home directory.)<br>
<br>
OpenVPN configuration files are stored in ~/Library/openvpn. Usually the key and certificate files are stored there, too.<br>
<br>
Since these files are all located in the user's Library folder, they must be set up separately for each user.<br>
<br>
<em>Note: At present, Tunnelblick does not work if the home folder is on a network volume.</em><br> 
<br>
Within the Tunnelblick.app application, client up/down scripts are
located in Tunnelblick.app/Contents/Resources (see the &ldquo;Set nameserver&rdquo;
checkbox in the <a href="#details" rel="nofollow">&ldquo;OpenVPN Log Window&rdquo; section</a>). To access
Tunnelblick.app/Contents in the Finder, control-click Tunnelblick.app
in the Applications folder, then click on &ldquo;Show Package Contents&rdquo;.<br>
<br>
<b><a name="firstuser" rel="nofollow">THE FIRST TIME TUNNELBLICK IS RUN BY EACH USER</a><br>
</b>When there are no configuration files in ~/Library/openvpn (which is usually the case the first time 
Tunnelblick is run by each user) the following screen will be displayed:<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="using-tunnelblick-files/using-tunnelblick-welcome.png" border="0"></div>
<p style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></p>
<br>
If you click &ldquo;Quit&rdquo;, Tunnelblick will quit without doing anything. If
you click &ldquo;Continue&rdquo;, Tunnelblick will create and save an example
OpenVPN configuration file, ~/Library/openvpn/openvpn.conf, and then
open it in TextEdit for you to modify. If you have an OpenVPN
configuration file that you are supposed to use, copy its contents,
paste them into this file (replacing the default contents), save, and exit TextEdit. Your configuration
(named &ldquo;openvpn.conf&rdquo;) is all set. Tunnelblick changes the ownership of
OpenVPN configuration files to root, so it is protected against
unnoticed and possibly malicious changes.<br>
<br>
If you have received key files or certificate files together with your
personal configuration file, please make sure to put them in
~/Library/openvpn/ (or another location as specified by your network administrator). OpenVPN will try to locate the key files in this
directory, unless absolute paths to them are specified in the configuration
file.<br>
<br>
<b><a name="first" rel="nofollow">THE FIRST TIME TUNNELBLICK IS RUN ON A COMPUTER</a><br>
</b>The first time Tunnelblick is run on a particular computer (but only the first time the first user runs it), it will display the following screen:<br>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center; clear: both;"><img src="using-tunnelblick-files/using-tunnelblick-password.png" border="0"></p>
<br>
<br>
Please enter the name and password of a computer administrator.
Tunnelblick's imbedded OpenVPN needs root privileges because it needs
to modify network settings by configuring new network devices,
changing routes, and adding and removing nameservers. Because we don't
want you to enter your administrator account name and password every
time you start a VPN connection, Tunnelblick comes with a setuid root
binary that allows it to do exactly one thing: start a VPN connection
with super user rights. Tunnelblick needs your administrator account
name password only on its first start after installation, so it can
create this setuid root binary.<br>
<br>
<b><a name="seconduser" rel="nofollow">THE SECOND TIME TUNNELBLICK IS RUN BY EACH USER</a><br>
</b>The second time Tunnelblick is run by each user, the following screen will be displayed:<br>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center; clear: both;"><img src="using-tunnelblick-files/using-tunnelblick-check.png" border="0"></p>
<br>
Specify whether or not you wish to have Tunnelblick check for updates.
Each time an update is available, you will be given a choice of whether to install the
update or not.<br>
<br>
<b><a name="normal" rel="nofollow">NORMAL TUNNELBLICK OPERATION</a><br>
</b>Once Tunnelblick has been started, you control it from the icon in
the menu bar at the top of your screen between the time and the
Spotlight icon. When no VPN connection is active, the icon is dark,
indicating a closed tunnel:<br>
<p style="text-align: left; clear: both;"></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center; clear: both;"><img src="using-tunnelblick-files/using-tunnelblick-closed.png" border="0"></p>
<br>
<br>
If you click on the icon, you'll see a drop down menu similar to the following:<br>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center; clear: both;"><img src="using-tunnelblick-files/using-tunnelblick-menu.png" border="0"></p>
<br>
There will be a &ldquo;Connect&rdquo; menu item for each .ovpn or .conf file in
~/Library/openvpn/. Click on one to establish the corresponding
pre-configured VPN connection. To illustrate the connection being
established, three dots will appear in the menu item, and the
Tunnelblick icon will darken and lighten repeatedly. If the connection
is successfully opened, the icon will change to show an open tunnel:<br>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center; clear: both;"><img src="using-tunnelblick-files/using-tunnelblick-open.png" border="0"></p>
<br>
You may be asked for a passphrase or username/password combination if
key/certificate files are not being used. You can save your passphrase
or password in Apple's Keychain by checking the appropriate checkbox. <br>
<br>
The connection will be active as long as you do not end it or log out.
Putting your computer to sleep or losing contact with the server (by lack
of wlan signal, for example) will make Tunnelblick periodically try to
re-establish the connection.<br>
<br>
If a connection error occurs, or in the unlikely event of an interface
crash, Tunnelblick will terminate the VPN tunnel and record the error
in your computer's syslog.<br>
<br>
Use &ldquo;Disconnect&rdquo; from the drop-down menu to close the VPN connection. Use
&ldquo;Quit&rdquo; to close the connection and quit the program and prevent
Tunnelblick from starting itself at your next login at your computer.
If Tunnelblick is running when you logout (or your computer crashes, or is shut down or restarted), 
then Tunnelblick will be started automatically upon login. To stop Tunnelblick from being 
started automatically upon login, be sure to quit Tunnelblick before logging out, either
by using the &ldquo;Quit&rdquo; command, or by using Command-Q (Apple-Q) when the &ldquo;OpenVPN Log&rdquo; window is active. (Don't confuse this automatic 
launch of Tunnelblick upon login with the &ldquo;Automatically connect on launch&rdquo; option, which 
causes a connection to be established when Tunnelblick is started, with this automatic launch
of Tunnelblick itself upon login.)<br>
<br>
<b><a name="details" rel="nofollow">THE &ldquo;OPENVPN LOG&rdquo; WINDOW</a></b><br>
Click on the Tunnelblick icon in the menu bar at the top of your screen between the time and the Spotlight
then click on &ldquo;Details&hellip;&rdquo; to obtain details for all connections (open or closed). A window similar to the following will appear:<br>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center; clear: both;"><img src="using-tunnelblick-files/using-tunnelblick-details.png" border="0"></p>
<br>
There will be a tab for each connection (i.e., each .ovpn or .conf file),
whether the connection is open or closed. Each tab contains a pane with
the OpenVPN Log for the connection and two checkboxes that provide
options for that connection:<br><ul><li>&ldquo;Automatically
connect on launch&rdquo; causes the connection to be opened when Tunnelblick
is launched (started). &ldquo;Automatically connect on launch&rdquo; is unchecked
by default.<br><br></li><li>&ldquo;Set nameserver&rdquo; causes scripts to be run
before a connection is opened and after the connection is closed. The
scripts, client.up.osx.sh and client.down.osx.sh, save and restore DNS
nameserver information. They are located in the Tunnelblick application
package at Tunnelblick.app/Contents/Resources. &ldquo;Set nameserver&rdquo; is
checked by default. The standard scripts for &ldquo;Set nameserver&rdquo; save the 
current DNS settings and remove them when a connection is opened, and restore 
the saved DNS settings when a connection is closed. They <em>do not</em> support 
the simultaneous use of two or more nameservers for different domains; custom up/down 
scripts must be used for this purpose.</li></ul>
In addition, the &ldquo;OpenVPN Log&rdquo; window contains four buttons:<br>
<ul><li>&ldquo;Clear log&rdquo; clears the OpenVPN Log for the connection being displayed.<br><br></li>
<li>&ldquo;Edit configuration&rdquo; starts TextEdit with the configuration file containing the OpenVPN configuration 
for the connection being displayed so it can be edited. Since configuration files are usually owned by 
root/wheel, they may only be edited by computer administrators.<br><br></li>
<li>&ldquo;Connect&rdquo; opens the connection being displayed.<br><br></li>
<li>&ldquo;Disconnect&rdquo; closes the connection being displayed.</li></ul>
You may use the standard keyboard shortcuts in the detail window: Command-C, 
Command-X, and Command-V for copy, cut, and paste; and Command-A, Command-M, Command-W, and 
Command-Q to select all the text in the log that is currently being displayed, minimize the window 
to the dock, close the window, and quit the program.<br>
<br>
<b><a name="about" rel="nofollow">THE &ldquo;ABOUT TUNNELBLICK&rdquo; WINDOW</a></b><br>
Click on the Tunnelblick icon in the menu bar at the top of your screen between the time and the Spotlight,
then click on &ldquo;About Tunnelblick&hellip;&rdquo; to open a window with information about the versions of 
Tunnelblick and OpenVPN that are running and a link to the Tunnelblick website.<br>
<br>
<b><a name="DNS" rel="nofollow">DNS SETTINGS</a></b><br>
Tunnelblick is set up for easy use when connecting to a VPN exclusively. That is, when you wish all
traffic (including DNS requests) to go through the tunnel. If so, use the &ldquo;Set nameserver&rdquo; checkbox to 
use the standard up/down scripts. If you wish to use the OS X ability to use different 
nameservers for different domains, you must create your own up/down scripts that set up the DNS and routing you desire.<br>
<br>
Note: Manual DNS settings are not modified by Tunnelblick. If your DNS is set manually then that DNS setting will override any
settings specified by the configuration scripts or the remote server.<br>
<br>
<b><a name="using" rel="nofollow">USING MORE THAN ONE VPN CONNECTION</a></b><br>
You can put more than one .ovpn or .conf file together with its key and/or
certificate files into the ~/Library/openvpn directory. Tunnelblick
interprets each .ovpn or .conf file in the ~/Library/openvpn directory as a
configuration file for a different connection; each of the connections
will be available in the drop down menu and shown as a separate tab in the &ldquo;OpenVPN Log&rdquo; window.<br>
<br>
<b><a name="simultaneously" rel="nofollow">USING MORE THAN ONE VPN CONNECTION SIMULTANEOUSLY</a></b><br>
Tunnelblick can maintain multiple simultaneous open connections to different VPNs.<br>
<br>
However, this is for experts only:<br>
<ul><li>If you use &ldquo;Set nameserver&rdquo; (which uses standard scripts to save/change/restore DNS resolution 
data), on one or more connections your 
DNS settings may not be saved and restored properly and DNS might or might not 
work. It depends on the order in what DNS settings you want to use and which connections are opened and closed. 
Connections may close and be reopened because of communications errors over which you have no control, which can cause
unpredictable results. Not recommended.</li>
<li>If you don't use &ldquo;Set nameserver&rdquo;, and your customized configuration 
files are suitably written to work together with custom scripts, things can work. But if you don't handle the DNS 
and routing settings properly, lots of things could go wrong. So this isn't recommended either unless you really 
know what you're doing and have a NEED to connect to multiple VPNs simultaneously.</li>
<li>VPN administrators might not be happy that you are connecting their networks together. Many VPN client 
software limits you to a single connection, probably for that reason.</li>
</ul>
<b><a name="autostart" rel="nofollow">AUTOMATICALLY STARTING TUNNELBLICK UPON LOGIN</a></b><br>
Tunnelblick was designed as a persistent menu icon that survives
reboots. To this end, it inserts itself into the login items when it is
started and only removes itself from the login items when you choose
Quit from the menu or Command-Q from the &ldquo;OpenVPN Log&rdquo; window. So if you just log out, shut down, 
or restart your computer, or it crashes, the next time you log in, Tunnelblick will automatically 
start. If you do not want Tunnelblick to start automatically, quit Tunnelblick before
you log out, shut down, or restart.<br>
<br>
<b><a name="autoopen" rel="nofollow">AUTOMATICALLY OPENING A VPN CONNECTION WHEN TUNNELBLICK STARTS</a></b><br>
You can specify that a connection automatically be opened when
Tunnelblick starts by putting a check in the &ldquo;Automatically connect on
launch&rdquo; checkbox for that connection. The checkbox is located on the
connection's tab in the &ldquo;OpenVPN Log&rdquo; window. <br>
<br>
<b><a name="preferences" rel="nofollow">PREFERENCES</a></b><br>
There is not yet a GUI for Tunnelblick's preferences.<br>
<br>
They are stored in ~/Library/Preferences/com.openvpn.tunnelblick.plist and can be inspected and edited with the 
&ldquo;defaults&rdquo; terminal command, which is documented on the 
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/Manpages/man1/defaults.1.html">defaults 
man page</a>. Example: to set the &ldquo;showAllDurations&rdquo; preference, the command would be:<br>
<br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;defaults write com.openvpn.tunnelblick showAllDurations 1</code><br>
<br>
Preferences can also be inspected and edited with the &ldquo;Property List Editor&rdquo;, which is a small part of the free Developer Tools available from Apple (a free 
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/products/membership.html">Apple Developer Connection membership</a> 
is required). The Developer Tools are a very large (over 900MB download) suite of programs for 
developing software for both Mac and iPhone software.<br>
<br>
Tunnelblick uses the following preferences for each user:<br>
<br>
<table border="1">
