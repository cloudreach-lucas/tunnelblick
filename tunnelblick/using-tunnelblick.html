Tunnelblick is an OS X Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the OpenVPN
open-source program, which maintains VPN "tunnels". It provides
easy-to-use control of OpenVPN server and/or client connections. It is
written in Cocoa, runs on OS X Tiger (10.4) and Leopard (10.5), and
comes as a ready to use application with all necessary binaries and
drivers, including OpenVPN. Tunnelblick is free software licensed under
the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html" rel="nofollow">GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2</a>.<br>

<b><a name="installing" rel="nofollow">INSTALLING TUNNELBLICK</a></b><br>
To install Tunnelblick, first download it from the featured downloads on the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/downloads/list" rel="nofollow">Downloads page</a>, then double-click the downloaded .dmg file. A new window similar to the following will appear:<br>
<br>
<p style="text-align: left; clear: both;"><img src="using-tunnelblick-files/using-tunnelblick-dmg.png" border="0"></p>
<br>
<br>
Drag Tunnelblick.app (which may be labeled "Tunnelblick" without the
".app") and drop it on the shortcut to the Applications folder. This
will copy the application from the .dmg into the Applications folder.
You may then close the window and eject the "Tunnelblick" disk icon.<br>
<br>
There is no need to install OpenVPN separately - the Tunnelblick
application contains both the Tunnelblick GUI and OpenVPN. See the
Tunnelblick release notes to determine the version of OpenVPN included
with the version of Tunnelblick that you are using.<br>
<br>
If you wish Tunnelblick to appear in the Dock, navigate to Applications, and drag and drop Tunnelblick to the Dock.<br>
<br>
<b><a name="updating" rel="nofollow">UPDATING TUNNELBLICK</a></b><br>
Tunnelblick will automatically check for updates and give you the option to install updated versions of the program.<br>
<br>
<b><a name="uninstalling" rel="nofollow">UNINSTALLING TUNNELBLICK</a><br>
</b>To uninstall Tunnelblick, move Tunnelblick.app from the
Applications folder to the Trash. Other than the preferences and
configuration files described in "File Locations", below, there are no
other files installed - OpenVPN and the tun/tap kernel extensions are
contained within the Tunnelblick.app package and are loaded only when
needed directly from there.<br>
<br>
<b><a name="configfiles" rel="nofollow">CONFIGURATION FILES</a><br>
</b>Each tunnel to be opened by Tunnelblick needs an OpenVPN configuration file. Tunnelblick considers any file 
located in ~/Library/openvpn with an extension of .conf or .ovpn to be a configuration file, and presents 
each file as a potential "connection". Usually these configuration files will be supplied to you. Refer to 
the <a href="http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation.html?Itemid=79">OpenVPN documentation</a> 
for details about what the configuration file should contain. (Note that the some OpenVPN options 
are available only on Windows; others are not available on Windows.)<br>
<br>
If Tunnelblick's "Set Nameserver" option is used:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Any "up" or "down" options in the configuration file will be ignored.</li>
  <li>If any "user" or "group" options appear in the configuration file, DNS settings will not be restored when a tunnel is disconnected.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b><a name="filelocations" rel="nofollow">FILE LOCATIONS</a><br>
</b>Tunnelblick preferences are contained in
~/Library/Preferences/com.openvpn.tunnelblick.plist.<br>
<br>
OpenVPN configuration, key, and certificate files are stored in
~/Library/openvpn.<br>
<br>
Since these files are all located in the user's
Library folder, each user of a computer must set them up separately.
(The "~" indicates your home directory.)<br>
<br>
Within the Tunnelblick.app application, client up/down scripts are
located in Tunnelblick.app/Contents/Resources (see the "Set Nameserver"
checkbox in "Details... Window", below). To access
Tunnelblick.app/Contents in the Finder, control-click Tunnelblick.app
in the Applications folder, then click on "Show Package Contents".<br>
<br>
<b><a name="thefirst" rel="nofollow">THE FIRST TIME TUNNELBLICK IS RUN</a><br>
</b>The first time Tunnelblick is run on a particular computer, it will display the following screen:<br>
<br>
<p style="text-align: left; clear: both;"><img src="using-tunnelblick-files/using-tunnelblick-password.png" border="0"></p>
<br>
<br>
Please enter the name and password of a computer administrator.
Tunnelblick's imbedded OpenVPN needs root privileges because it needs
to modify network settings by configuring new network devices,
changing routes, and adding and removing nameservers. Because we don't
want you to enter your administrator account name and password every
time you start a VPN connection, Tunnelblick comes with a setuid root
binary that allows it to do exactly one thing: start a VPN connection
with super user rights. Tunnelblick needs your administrator account
name password only on its first start after installation, so it can
create this setuid root binary.<br>
<br>
The following screen will also be displayed:<br>
<br>
<p style="text-align: left; clear: both;"><img src="using-tunnelblick-files/using-tunnelblick-check.png" border="0"></p>
<br>
Specify whether or not you wish to have Tunnelblick check for updates.
If an update is available, you will be given a choice to install the
update or not.<br>
<br>
The first time Tunnelblick is run on each login account (when there are no configuration files in
~/Library/openvpn), it will display the following screen:<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: left;"><img src="using-tunnelblick-files/using-tunnelblick-welcome.png" border="0"></div>
<p style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></p>
<br>
If you click "Quit", Tunnelblick will quit without doing anything. If
you click "Continue", Tunnelblick will create and save an example
OpenVPN configuration file, ~/Library/openvpn/openvpn.conf, and then
open it in TextEdit for you to modify. If you have an OpenVPN
configuration file that you are supposed to use, copy its contents (replacing the default contents),
paste them into this file, save, and exit TextEdit. Your configuration
(named "openvpn.conf") is all set. Tunnelblick changes the ownership of
the OpenVPN configuration file to root, so it is protected against
unnoticed and possibly malicious changes.<br>
<br>
If you have received key files or certificate files together with your
personal configuration file, please make sure to put them in
~/Library/openvpn/. OpenVPN will try to locate the key files in this
directory, unless the paths to them are specified in the configuration
file in absolute terms.<br>
<br>
<b><a name="normal" rel="nofollow">NORMAL TUNNELBLICK OPERATION</a><br>
</b>Once Tunnelblick has been started, you control it from the icon in
the menu bar at the top of your screen between the time and the
Spotlight icon. When no VPN connection is active, the icon is dark,
indicating a closed tunnel:<br>
<p style="text-align: left; clear: both;"></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: left; clear: both;"><img src="using-tunnelblick-files/using-tunnelblick-closed.png" border="0"></p>
<br>
<br>
If you click on the icon, you'll see a drop down menu similar to the following:<br>
<br>
<p style="text-align: left; clear: both;"><img src="using-tunnelblick-files/using-tunnelblick-menu.png" border="0"></p>
<br>
There will be a "Connect" menu item for each .ovpn or .conf file in
~/Library/openvpn/. Click on one to establish the corresponding
pre-configured VPN connection. To illustrate the connection being
established, three dots will appear in the menu item, and the
Tunnelblick icon will darken and lighten repeatedly. When the connection
was successfully created, the icon will change to show an open tunnel:<br>
<br>
<p style="text-align: left; clear: both;"><img src="using-tunnelblick-files/using-tunnelblick-open.png" border="0"></p>
<br>
You may be asked for a passphrase or username/password combination if
key/certificate files are not being used. You can save your passphrase
or password in Apple's Keychain by checking the appropriate checkbox. <br>
<br>
The connection will be active as long as you do not end it or log out.
Putting your computer to sleep or losing contact with the server (by lack
of wlan signal, for example) will make Tunnelblick periodically try to
re-establish the connection.<br>
<br>
If a connection error occurs, or in the unlikely event of an interface
crash, Tunnelblick will terminate the VPN tunnel and record the error
in your computer's syslog.<br>
<br>
Use "Disconnect" from the drop-down menu to end the VPN connection. Use
"Quit" to end the connection and quit the program and prevent
Tunnelblick from starting itself at your next login at your computer.
If "Quit" is not used (for example, if you use log out or shut
down the computer or use command-Q to quit Tunnelblick while displaying the
"Details" window), then Tunnelblick will be started automatically upon
login.<br>
<br>
<b><a name="using" rel="nofollow">USING MORE THAN ONE VPN CONNECTION</a></b><br>
You can put more than one .ovpn or .conf file together with its key and/or
certificate files into the ~/Library/openvpn directory. Tunnelblick
interprets each .ovpn or .conf file in the ~/Library/openvpn directory as a
configuration file for a different connection; each of the connections
will be available in the drop down menu.<br>
<br>
<b><a name="details" rel="nofollow">DETAILS... WINDOW</a></b><br>
Click on "Details..." to obtain details for all connections (open or closed). A window similar to the following will appear:<br>
<br>
<p style="text-align: left; clear: both;"><img src="using-tunnelblick-files/using-tunnelblick-details.png" border="0"></p>
<br>
There will be a tab for each connection (i.e., each .ovpn or .conf file),
whether the connection is open or closed. Each tab contains a pane with
the OpenVPN log for the connection and two checkboxes that provide
options for that connection:<br><ul><li>"Automatically
connect on launch" causes the connection to be opened when Tunnelblick
is launched (started). "Automatically connect on launch" is unchecked
by default.<br><br></li><li>"Set Nameserver" causes scripts to be run
before a connection is opened and after the connection is closed. The
scripts, client.up.osx.sh and client.down.osx.sh, save and restore DNS
nameserver information. They are located in the Tunnelblick application
package at Tunnelblick.app/Contents/Resources. "Set Nameserver" is
checked by default.</li></ul>
In addition, the Details window contains four buttons:<br>
<ul><li>"Clear Log" clears the OpenVPN log for the connection being displayed.<br><br></li>
<li>"Edit Configuration" opens the configuration file containing the OpenVPN configuration for the connection being displayed in TextEdit.<br><br></li>
<li>"Connect" opens the connection being displayed.<br><br></li><li>"Disconnect" closes the connection being displayed.</li></ul>
<b><a name="autostart" rel="nofollow">AUTOMATICALLY STARTING TUNNELBLICK UPON LOGIN</a></b><br>
Tunnelblick was designed as a persistent menu icon that survives
reboots. To this end, it inserts itself into the login items when it is
started and only removes itself from the login items when you choose
Quit from the menu. So if you just log out or shut down your computer,
the next time you log in, Tunnelblick will automatically start. If you
do not want Tunnelblick to start automatically, quit Tunnelblick before
you log out or shut down. <br>
<br>
<b><a name="autoopen" rel="nofollow">AUTOMATICALLY OPENING A VPN CONNECTION WHEN TUNNELBLICK STARTS</a></b><br>
You can specify that a connection automatically be opened when
Tunnelblick starts by putting a check in the "Automatically connect on
launch" checkbox for that connection. The checkbox is located on the
connection's tab in the "Details" window. <br>
<br>
<b><a name="command" rel="nofollow">COMMAND-LINE INTERFACE</a></b><br>
Tunnelblick also contains openvpnstart, an OS X command line interface
to OpenVPN which provides a scriptable way to create and destroy
OpenVPN tunnels. openvpnstart is located in
Tunnelblick.app/Contents/Resources.<br>
