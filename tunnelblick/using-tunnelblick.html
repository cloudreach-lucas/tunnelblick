 <h2><a name="What_is_Tunnelblick?">What is Tunnelblick?</a></h2><ul><li><a
 name="What_is_Tunnelblick?"><strong>Explanation 1</strong>: Tunnelblick
 is a program that can be used to securely connect a Mac running OS X to
 a remote network or the Internet, bypassing untrusted networks, 
censorship, and eavesdropping. It does this by creating a "Virtual 
Private Network", or "</a><a 
href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Virtual_Private_Network" 
rel="nofollow">VPN</a> <tt>[</tt>wiktionary.org<tt>]</tt>", to a VPN 
server using a program named "OpenVPN", which is included within the 
Tunnelblick application. When you connect through a VPN, your computer 
sends all network traffic through a "tunnel" to the VPN server, which 
then passes on your network traffic to a local network or the Internet. 
It is as if you were connecting to the network or Internet through the 
VPN server instead of your computer. Usually, all traffic between your 
computer and the VPN server is encrypted. </li></ul><blockquote>VPNs are
 primarily used two ways, or sometimes both ways simultaneously: 
<ul><li>To securely connect a computer to the Internet, even though it 
may be connecting through an untrusted network (a wireless network at a 
hotel or airport, for example); and </li><li>To securely connect a 
computer to a company's internal network or some part of it (a branch 
office, for example). </li></ul></blockquote><blockquote>In addition to 
Tunnelblick, you need access to a VPN server. Your company may provide 
one, or you can obtain VPN service from any of several VPN service 
providers, or you can use another one of your computers or a router to 
act as a VPN server. 
</blockquote><ul><li><strong>Explanation 2</strong>: Tunnelblick is a 
ready-to-use Graphic User Interface (GUI) for OpenVPN on Mac OS X. It 
provides easy-to-use control of OpenVPN server and/or client 
connections. </li></ul><blockquote>It runs on OS X Tiger (10.4), Leopard
 (10.5), and Snow Leopard (10.6). It comes as a ready-to-use Universal 
application with all necessary binaries and drivers (including OpenVPN 
and tun/tap) included. No additional installation is necessary -- just 
add your configuration and encryption information. 
</blockquote><blockquote>Tunnelblick is free software licensed under the
 GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2.

separately - the Tunnelblick application contains both the Tunnelblick 
GUI and OpenVPN. </a></p><p><a name="Installing_Tunnelblick">First, 
download the latest disk image from the featured downloads section on 
the </a><a href="http://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/" rel="nofollow">Tunnelblick
 project page</a>. Double-click the downloaded .dmg file. An icon for a 
"Tunnelblick” disk will appear on the Desktop, and a window similar to 
the following will appear: </p><p><img

 the Tunnelblick icon and a new window will appear, similar to the 
following: </p><p><img 
src="using-tunnelblick-install-2010-02-06.png"> </p><p>If
 you are reinstalling, upgrading, or downgrading Tunnelblick, the window
 will show the version number of the current copy and of the new copy. 
The current copy of Tunnelblick will be put in the Trash before it is 
replaced. </p><p>Click the "Install" button to copy Tunnelblick to your 
hard drive at the indicated location. </p><p>Once that is done (it may 
take a couple of seconds), a new window will appear, similar to the 
following: </p><p><img 
src="using-tunnelblick-launch-2010-02-06.png"> </p><p>If
 you want to launch Tunnelblick now, click the "Launch" button. </p><p>If
 Tunnelblick is currently running, a window similar to the following 
will appear: </p><p><img 
src="using-tunnelblick-running-2010-02-06.png"> </p><p>Click
 the "Close VPN Connections and Stop Tunnelblick" to continue. After all
 connections are closed and Tunnelblick has quit, the new version of 
Tunnelblick will be launched. Continue with the following sections. </p><h2><a

 name="The_First_Time_Tunnelblick_is_Run_on_a_Computer">Please enter the
 name and password of a computer administrator. Tunnelblick's imbedded 
OpenVPN needs root privileges because it needs to modify network 
settings by configuring new network devices, changing routes, and adding
 and removing nameservers. Because we don't want you to enter your 
administrator account name and password every time you start a VPN 
connection, Tunnelblick comes with a setuid root binary that allows it 
to start a VPN connection with super user rights. Tunnelblick uses your 
administrator account name and password so it can create this setuid 
root binary. </a></p><p><a

your passphrase or password in Apple's Keychain by checking the 
appropriate checkbox. </a></p><p><a name="Normal_Tunnelblick_Operation">The
 connection will be active as long as you do not end it or log out. 
Putting your computer to sleep will close the connection but upon waking
 up from sleep Tunnelblick will attempt to reestablish the connection. 
If Tunnelblick loses contact with the server (because of a lack of 
wireless signal, for example), it will periodically try to re-establish 
the connection. </a></p><p><a name="Normal_Tunnelblick_Operation">If a 
connection error occurs, or in the unlikely event of an interface crash,
 Tunnelblick will terminate the VPN tunnel and record the error in the 
Console Log. </a></p><p><a name="Normal_Tunnelblick_Operation">Use 
"Disconnect” from the drop-down menu to close the VPN connection. Use 
"Quit” to close all open connections and quit the program and prevent 
Tunnelblick from starting itself at your next login at your computer. </a></p><p><a

logout (or your computer crashes, or is shut down or restarted), then 
Tunnelblick will be started automatically upon login. To stop 
Tunnelblick from being started automatically upon login, be sure to quit
 Tunnelblick before logging out, either by using the "Quit” command, or 
by using Command-Q (Apple-Q) when the "OpenVPN Log” or "About...” window 
is active. (Don't confuse this automatic launch of Tunnelblick upon 
login with the "Automatically connect on launch” option, which causes a 
connection to be established when Tunnelblick is started.) </a></p><h2><a

 you're using Leopard (10.5) or Tiger (10.4), then it is possible to use
 the VPN-server-supplied DNS and WINS settings <strong>in addition to</strong>
 your manual settings by checking the "Set nameserver" box. However, 
your manual settings will always take precedence over any VPN

 nameserver” (which uses standard scripts to save/change/restore DNS 
resolution data), on one or more connections your DNS settings may not 
be saved and restored properly and DNS might or might not work. It 
depends on the order in what DNS settings you want to use and which 
connections are opened and closed. Connections may close and be reopened
 because of communications errors over which you have no control, which 
can cause unpredictable results. Not recommended. </a></li><li><a 
name="Using_More_than_One_VPN_Connection_Simultaneously">If you don't 
use "Set nameserver”, and your customized configuration files are 
suitably written to work together with custom scripts, things can work. 
But if you don't handle the DNS and routing settings properly, lots of 
things could go wrong. So this isn't recommended either unless you 
really know what you're doing and have a NEED to connect to multiple 
VPNs simultaneously. </a></li><li><a 
name="Using_More_than_One_VPN_Connection_Simultaneously">VPN 
administrators might not be happy that you are connecting their networks
 together. Most VPN client software limits you to a single connection,

it inserts itself into the login items when it is started and only 
removes itself from the login items when you choose Quit from the menu

 you just log out, shut down, or restart your computer, or it crashes, 
the next time you log in, Tunnelblick will automatically start. If you

name="Using_openvpn-down-root.so">Using openvpn-down-root.so</a></h2><p><a
 name="Using_openvpn-down-root.so">When using "Set nameserver", it is 
usually necessary to avoid using the OpenVPN "user" and "group" options.
 These options cause OpenVPN to drop root privileges and take the 
privileges of the specified user and group. It this is done, then the 
standard scripts that handle restarting connections when there is a

version 3.0b22, Tunnelblick includes the "openvpn-down-root.so" plugin 
for OpenVPN. It is located in theTunnelblick.app/Contents/Resources" 
folder. This plugin, when activated by including a line in the 
configuration file, allows the use of the "user" and "group" options, so
 that OpenVPN drops root privileges, but still has the scripts run as 
root, so reconnecting after transient network problems, or restoring 
routes when a tunnel is disconnected continue to work. </a></p><p><a

there are no other files installed -- OpenVPN, the tun/tap kernel

Files</a></h2><p><a name="Configuration_Files">Each tunnel to be opened 
by Tunnelblick needs an OpenVPN configuration file. Tunnelblick 
considers any file located in ~/Library/Application 
Support/Tunnelblick/Configurations with an extension of .conf or .ovpn 
to be a configuration file, and presents each such file as a potential 
"connection”. (The "~" refers to your home folder.) Often these 
configuration files will be supplied to you. Refer to </a><a 
href="http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/manuals/69-openvpn-21.html"
 rel="nofollow">the OpenVPN documentation</a> for details about what the
 configuration file should contain. (Note that some OpenVPN options are 
available only on Windows.) </p><p>When using a "deployed" version of 
Tunnelblick, configuration files are all located within the Tunnelblick 
application itself, so ~/Library/Application 
Support/Tunnelblick/Configurations is not used for configuration files 
(although it may be used for keys, certificates, and/or shell scripts). 
See the <a 
href="http://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/wiki/DeployingTunnelblick" 
rel="nofollow">Deploying Tunnelblick</a> wiki for details. </p><p>Tunnelblick
 monitors the folder that contains the configuration files. If a 
configuration file is added, the new configuration is available 
immediately without restarting Tunnelblick or disturbing existing 
connections. If a  configuration is removed from the folder, any 
connection using that configuration is immediately disconnected. To 
disable this behavior, use "doNotMonitorConfigurationFolder". (See the <a
 href="http://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/wiki/Preferences" 
rel="nofollow">Preferences wiki</a>.) </p><p>The configuration file may 
also be "shadow" copied to the /Library/Application Support 
Tunnelblick/Users/<i>username</i> folder. This is done transparently for
 configuration files located on network volumes. The user should never 
manipulate this folder or its contents directly; Tunnelblick will do so 
automatically. (See "useShadowConfigurationFiles" in the <a 
href="http://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/wiki/Preferences" 
rel="nofollow">Preferences wiki</a>.) </p><p>If Tunnelblick's "Set

 1: Prior to Tunnelblick version 3.0b24, configuration files were stored
 in ~/Library/openvpn. Version 3.0b24 and later versions automatically 
move that folder to its new location, and replace it with a symbolic 
link to the new location. </p><p>Note 2: <i>Deployed</i> versions of 
Tunnelblick contain the configuration file(s), so they do not need to be
